[Drop-In Auto Sear -- DIAS](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/e33b43092b8c30768cf222d4a02fe8c2/large.JPG)\n\nFrom an engineering/3D printing standpoint, it's a simple device to make.

It's not necessarily illegal to print and own a DIAS. However, if you own a firearm that has the capability of accepting said device, even if you've never installed it in the firearm, it is considered constructive possession. The same goes for if you had the 2D CAD files on your computer and also own firearms that can accept said DIAS, its also considered constructive possession.\n\n*****\n\nAs far as the bump stock, that ban is likely going to be thrown out as unconstitutional in a district court or at SCOTUS. I've followed the policy involving them going back years and the way it is worded is poor and vague, likely making the law void. Just like the \"You now have to be 21 to buy any gun in FL\" law passed after Parkland, that will likely also be overturned as it is unconstitutional to limit a constitutional right to a certain group of people based on arbitrary factors.\n\nWas this kid going to go nuts and shoot up the school? Can't really say. Sounds more like he is a rebel-like kinda person and thought making them would be a fun experiment. Plus shooting a full-auto is fun.\n\nI also want to point out some ambiguity in the article here. This was quoted in the article:\n\n>UCF policy prohibits weapons from being possessed or stored on university property, but allows for them to be kept in a private vehicle as long as they are \u201cnot readily accessible for immediate use.\u201d\n\n\nThat does not mean it has to be locked inside a safe inside your vehicle. According to FL statutes, it is defined as:\n\n>790.01 for a person 18 years of age or older to possess a concealed firearm or other weapon for self-defense or other lawful purpose within the interior of a private conveyance, without a license, if the firearm or other weapon is securely encased **OR** is otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use*.\" (emphasis mine).\n\nThat means it has to qualify as either:\n\n* A - Securely Encased\n* B - Otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use\n\nAnyone in the state of FL who is legally allowed to own a firearm is allowed to have their firearm in their vehicle if on campus. You CANNOT carry it with you outside your vehicle onto school property, but you have every right to keep it in your glove box, console, under the seat safe, etc.. It's perfectly legal and not against university policy. \n\nI hope that more and more people see these kinds of incidents (especially the one the article cites from 2013) that the only people bringing guns into a gun-free zone (i.e. the campus), everyone else is left unarmed against an attacker. Now more than ever we need to allow campus carry at our schools from K thru college. I, the law obeying citizen, cannot carry my gun outside my vehicle, but people like this guy don't give a rat's ass about the law. So why am I being forced to be disarmed? When university police are likely 3-10 minutes away in the event of an active shooter. I don't want my life in the hands of some madman hurting innocent people. I want the option to defend myself if the need arises.\n\n*****\n\nSome clarification on the law here below, for anyone who is curious.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>WHERE CAN I KEEP MY GUN IN MY CAR?\n\nThis is a question commonly asked, but rarely able to be answered. You may keep, with or without a license, a firearm in your \"private conveyance\", otherwise known as a vehicle. Fl. Stat. s. 790.251(5) states \"it is lawful and is not a violation of s. 790.01 for a person 18 years of age or older to possess a concealed firearm or other weapon for self-defense or other lawful purpose within the interior of a private conveyance, without a license, if the firearm or other weapon is securely encased or is otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use.\" The important, and most often misunderstood, parts of this provision are the phrases \"securely encased\" and \"not readily accessible\".\n\n\"Securely encased\" means:\n\n* ***in a glove compartment***, whether or not locked; \n\n* ***snapped in a holster***;*** in a gun case***, whether or not locked;\n\n* ***in a zippered gun case***; \n\n* or ***in a closed box or container which requires a lid or cover to be opened for access.*** \n\nFl. Stat. 790.001(17) (emphasis added). \n\nAn important note in the list bolded/italicized previously is that whatever you keep your gun in it must be ***closed*** **but not** **necessarily** ***locked***. \n\nNow, there is the second option of storing your gun in your vehicle where it is not \"readily accessible for immediate use\". \"readily accessible for immediate use\" is when \"a firearm or other weapon is carried on the person or within such close proximity and in such a manner that it can be retrieved and used as easily and quickly as if carried on the person.\" Fl. Stat. 790.001(16). \n\n\n##Keep in mind, this statute ***DOES NOT*** require you to carry your firearm securely encased and not readily accessible for immediate use; \n\nthe statute states that either way is lawful. Also, if you do have a concealed carry license, remember, that you can carry it in any place but for those listed previously and in the state statutes.\n\n[source]\n(http://www.solerslacklaw.com/Criminal-Defense/Florida-Gun-Law.aspx)", "[deleted]", "TY. I also mentioned this in detail in another post I made. \n\nAnd like I mentioned, even just owning a DIAS that isn't NFA/GCA approved if you own a gun that can accept it is constructive possession and illegal.

The AR-15 was found inside the vehicle and Chambers admitted to owning it, police said.\n\nAn FDLE firearm instructor test-fired the weapon and confirmed it was fully automatic, the affidavit said. The gun was found with a brand-new six-round magazine, but was able to fire at least 19 rounds consecutively with a single trigger pull, police said.\n\n\u201cThe test fire confirmed the AR-15 is a machine gun,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nAccording to police, Chambers confessed to manufacturing three of the devices in December and testing one on the AR-15 earlier this month. He said he knew using the device was illegal, \u201cbut said he does not like laws,\u201d according to the arrest affidavit.\n\nFlorida\u2019s recently-enacted ban on so-called bump-fire stocks, which convert semiautomatic firearms to mimic fully-automatic weapons, prohibits the possession of any device which alters the firing rate of a gun to replicate automatic weapon fire.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Chambers also possessed a bump stock. He faces charges of possession of a machine gun and a bump-fire stock.

If so, awesome.  Second, the comment after yours gets to what I was implying.  Whittaker\u2019s former position would not have existed in a vacuum.  He was appointed Provost and Vice President in 2014.  As Provost, he would have been responsible for the academics and their budgets, whereas the President would encompass all decision making on behalf of the Board.\n\nIn 2013, research was done on the old building and it was deemed structurally unsafe.  This went beyond just mold and asbestos, the building was literally beginning to fall apart and the structural integrity was given 1-2 years at most.  That was five years ago.  I work in the new building and we moved in August 2018, with barely enough time to start the new semester.  Construction really began mid 2017.  I think those details in themselves warrant some important questions, such as, if the building was deemed unsafe, why did it take so long for the university to move faculty and students into a safer location?\n\nI\u2019m not an engineer, but it appears as though the new building went up extremely fast, and the demolition of the old building was paramount in the past four months.  Why the rush?  The library, the student union and the downtown campus have been under construction for at least two-three years now, and those project still won\u2019t be completed until either end of this year or early next.\n\nI also want to make it clear to, that it\u2019s not just this building that\u2019s causing the exigence of this investigation.  Reports are circulating around $84 million of misspent funds\u2014 Trevor Colbourn Hall only cost $34 million.\n\nThe misused funds did not come from construction funds, but from other sources.  Sources Whittaker would have overseen and should have been aware of.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the new building, and it has made working much easier and enjoyable again, especially knowing that my health isn\u2019t at risk, or that the elevators won\u2019t fall to hades.  However, if the scapegoat is going to be that they did this for the safety of the faculty, staff, and students, there is no urgency sensed behind their statements, or by the actual events that led to the construction of the new building.  \n\n", "Dale did not come off the streets and become president.

In fact you'll have very few problems with anything blocking the river, at least up to the train bridge 2 miles up.  And it's actually beautiful when the water is low (I prefer it lower for this launch), you can glide across sandy spots that are a foot deep.  Once you make it up to the bridge you can explore a little side pond, and then just coast back home.\n\n[Here's a chart](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=02233484) of the water levels.  Change the start date to a few months ago to see the trends.  Right now it's ~400 cubic feet per second which is pretty good, last year after the hurricane it was 9000 cubic feet per second (which means you can explore places like the small southwest branch from 419, up to near the Riverside Park where you may also be able to put in).   \n\nThe upper branch (at 419) is a bit more difficult, especially in low water, with more trees across the river and hidden strainers underwater that you have to look out for.  And you may need to make a portage or two, but not always.  And you either go upriver and fight against a lot of trees (although it is very beautiful and secluded), or downriver and then have to paddle back upstream to the launch when finished.  So I prefer Snowhill just so that I can put my energy into paddling first, then just relax and float home when I get tired.

What I'm saying is they do no good if your ISP decides to disallow VPNs on their networks. All they'd need to do is stick a clause in their terms of use and cut your service if they notice you using one.\n\nActually TorGuard was one of the ones I used and gave up on it since I couldn't stream Netflix with even minimal quality. Multiplayer gaming was also impossible since it would send my ping through the roof. This was some time go though, perhaps they've improved their service.

Korea. Most of that time predates VPNs actually being a violation of Netflix's TOS to my knowledge. Technology changes rapidly though, it would continue to be a race between VPN services and their undetectable proxies, and ISPs' proxy detection software.\n\nSince they are private companies and not regulated like telecoms and utilities are, ISPs are under no obligation to provide internet service to anyone. If they decide they don't like VPN users, they can cut your service if they see ANY evidence of you using one, leaving you stuck with your own mobile internet (that is, assuming they don't reinstate tethering fees like Verizon used to do).
